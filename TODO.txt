On monocore version we can add :
- Signal system
	so a thread will be able to send a signal to another one.
	like thread_kill(thread_t);
- Detect a stackoverflow with mprotect
- Add mutex between thread

On multi-core version :
Make th version work (Martin is on it, the source code is upside down and he's facing a lot of deadlocks and segfault)
