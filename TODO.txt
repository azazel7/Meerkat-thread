On monocore version we can add :
- Signal system
	so a thread will be able to send a signal to another one.
	like thread_kill(thread_t);
- Detect a stackoverflow with mprotect
- Add mutex between thread

On multi-core version : (The source code seem good now, you can read it safely.)
- Find a way to kill properly all core (pthread thread)
- Find how free all global varial after a main return instead of a thread_exit
- Try to replace our mutex by spin_locks so we will be faster
- A good way (macro ?) to remove debug printf
