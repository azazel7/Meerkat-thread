On multi-core version : (The source code seem good now, you can read it safely.)
- Find a way to kill properly all core (pthread thread)
- Signal system
	so a thread will be able to send a signal to another one.
	like thread_kill(thread_t);
- Add mutex between thread
- Repport
- Find a way in cmake to add flags compilation of glib /!\
	* Or recreate the trashStack (which is easy I think)
- Find out why LIST_APPEND of systemd's list is far slower than our list__add_end /!\
- Profile the application
	* To know where the application spend all its time
	* Go faster and better
