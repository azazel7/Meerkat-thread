On multi-core version : (The source code seem good now, you can read it safely.)
- Find a way to kill properly all core (pthread thread)
- Signal system
	so a thread will be able to send a signal to another one.
	like thread_kill(thread_t);
- Detect a stackoverflow with mprotect
- Add mutex between thread
- To go faster
	* Replace list in htable by balenced tree (log(N))
	* Change the list so we can read it during a modification (only one) (rwlock)
	* Replace thread_t into a void* and the joiner will free the dead thread (no more need of htable)
