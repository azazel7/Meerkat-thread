On monocore version we can add :
- Agree with the teacher that we don't need monocore anymore ! 
	* If he doesn't, make him understand there will be an upraising if he keep thinking that way.

On multi-core version : (The source code seem good now, you can read it safely.)
- Find a way to kill properly all core (pthread thread)
- Find how free all global varial after a main return instead of a thread_exit
- Try to replace mutexs by spin_locks so we will be faster
	* Try to implement our own mutex, spinlocks and semaphore so we will be faster
- Change the use of a context in core (a stack for each core)
- Signal system
	so a thread will be able to send a signal to another one.
	like thread_kill(thread_t);
- Detect a stackoverflow with mprotect
- Add mutex between thread
